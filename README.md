# wireshark_packet

**Tool**: Wireshark  
**System**: Winows 
**Interface Used**: Wi-Fi  

**Objective**:  
To capture live network traffic, analyze common protocols, and understand how data flows across a network. The captured `.pcap` file is analyzed using protocol filters, and findings are documented here.

**Protocols Found**:
DNS   -    Domain Name System |
HTTP  -    Hypertext Transfer Protocol |
TCP   -   Transmission Control Protocol |
UDP   -    User Datagram Protocol |
ICMP  -   Internet Control Message Protocol|
TLS   -   Transport Layer Security |
ARP   -    Address Resolution Protocol |
QUIC  -    Quick UDP Internet Connections |
mDNS  -    Multicast DNS|  


- Most frequent traffic: HTTP and DNS  
- TLS traffic observed â€“ secure communications  
- ICMP used for network diagnostics (ping)  
- ARP/mDNS traffic indicates local network discovery



Conclusion
This hands-on session provided practical experience in capturing and analyzing network packets using Wireshark. Key protocols like DNS, HTTP, ICMP, and TLS were identified. This is a foundational skill for networking, cybersecurity, and digital forensics roles.
